# Digital Creative History

Hey. The name's Jeff. I love to learn, experiment, and create.

My digital authorship is generalled signed with  "featherless". This repo is the index of my
[featherless](https://github.com/featherless) org where I attempt to capture reflections on the
works I've taken part in.

Welcome to my digital creative history. It will always be a work in progress.

---

What follows is a reverse-chronological timeline. **As you scroll down you move further into my
past**. Creations are bucketed by month and I provide my annual birth date for a reference point.

### Today

Working at Google. I mentor teams interested in operating in the open. I advise on
designing shared software libraries that are used across Google's 80+ shipping iOS
applications. More and more I'm mentoring Googlers on the Swift language.

### 2016: April

Had a blast making one hour of a 24 hour mix collection of music with a friend.

[The Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102507563304900&set=a.10101448998781690.2346833.6912638&type=3&theater)

### 2016: January

I started learning how to mix electronic music using a Traktor Kontrol S2. I made a goal for myself
to do two things as often as I could:

- Listen to 100 new tracks from Soundcloud.
- Make a mix.

I listen to a lot of electronic music so I also spin a lot of different kinds of sets. I don't plan
to focus on any one genre over another until I feel that my technical skills have developed. My
primary goal is to keep having fun while doing this.

[Listen to all sets I've made thus far on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/featherless/sets/locally-grown-artisanal-sets).

### 2015: August

Camped with Robot Heart at Burning Man for the second time. Rigged the lights for Shady Bot, the
Heart, and helped with Brandeaux.

### 2014: November

Returned to work at Google on the [Material design team](https://design.google.com/) to complete
the work I started just before leaving in 2013.

### 2014: October

Lit Brandeaux for Robot Heart's annual halloween fundraiser.

### 2014: August

Camped with Robot Heart at Burning Man for the first time. Helped light up the Shady Bot art car.
Also left mid-way through burn week to fly directly to a friend's wedding in Toronto!

### 2013: April

I left the Google Maps iOS team after shipping v1.1 in order to travel.

I practiced my first official "step-down" process by going out of my way to hand off responsibility
to other members of the team. [mog](https://github.com/stephanemoore), for example, took ownership
of much of the day-to-day nimbus maintenance.

### 2012: December

Shipped Google Maps iOS after just six months of development.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/GoogleMaps-iOS/master/photos/google-maps-ios.jpg)

Invested significant effort in polishing the app's user experience.

I also built the foundation for what became Google's Material design iOS efforts during this time.

The app received high praise by the press:

  - Mobile App of the Year. Crunchies 2012.
  - Best User Experience. Webby Awards 2012.
  - Best Use of GPS. Webby Awards 2012.

### 2012: October

Built the "bottom drawer" gesture-driven interface as part of Google Maps iOS.

I took great care to polish the behavior of the bottom drawer. Notable behavior includes:

- the ability to dismiss the full-screen content by dragging down past the top,
- the ability to toss the drawer into a full-screen mode in a natural manner,
- support for mid-expansion and full-expansion.

One thing I would have liked to improve is for content to detach momentarily as the rubber-banding
is taking effect the content. This would provide a better hint to the: a toss to the top
user for how to dismiss the content.

### 2012: February

Moved to a new team at Google.

I moved to the Google+ games iOS team where I built and documented
[a significant amount of the API](https://developers.google.com/games/services/ios/quickstart).

### 2011: September

Started my first full-time salaried job at Google.

I joined the Google+ team. I initially worked on the Google+ iPad app.

Graduated from university.



<p align="center">↑ turned 23 :: graduated university :: 2010 ↑</p>

### 2010: June

I took on the Facebook iPad app project as the sole engineer. I worked closely with Brandon
Walkin through this time.

### 2010: May

My mother passed away unexpectedly. I started a habit of writing notes of appreciation to
people. Sometimes I give the note to the person. Sometimes I stick the note in a book I keep
in a safe place. I also started making regular digital backups of my life including tax
filings, employment information, landlord and rental information, and passwords to various
accounts.

### 2009: September to December

Second internship at Facebook.

I worked with Owen Yamauchi and Joe Hewitt on the Facebook iOS app. I took ownership of the
Three20 project after the internship.

I worked on the Google Calendar team. I made it so that event chips are the color of the calendar
you're about to create them on (they used to just always be grey).

### 2007: September to December

Third internship at Sony Creative Software.

### 2003: Summer

Attended the National Youth Leadership Forum on Technology. This was the first time I visited the
Bay Area.

As part of this group we built a game — Escape from the Funky Factory — and presented it at the
conference.

### 2003: May 3 to July 26

Created [Escape from the Funky Factory](https://github.com/featherless/2003-EscapeFromTheFunkyFactory) in collaboration with The Developers Alliance.

### 2003: February or March

Lost a significant amount of data due to a wiped hard drive.

### 2003: February

Working on the 3d version of the [Blood Right](https://github.com/featherless/2002-2003-Blood-Right) game.

### Learned that code can be written

Not until a friend of mine showed me that he could edit the source to a website did I realize
that it was within my reach to write my own computer programs.

During my second and third grade years I made "paper platformer" games. I would take a piece
of paper, fold it down the middle vertical and then make four equally-spaced horizontal cuts.
This allowed me to make a "book" with a front and back cover and 7 internal "full-width" pages.

Each full-width page was a hand-drawn level that looked like a cut-out side view of a building.
There were monsters that you'd have to blow up with bazookas, trampolines to jump over chasms
with, and ladders to move between levels.

Thinking back on it now, I may have been attempting to recreate Bugs Bunny for the Game Boy.
I wasn't allowed to bring my Game Boy to school, so I'd draw these paper games and play them
on the bus instead.
