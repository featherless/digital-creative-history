# Digital Creative History

Hey. The name's Jeff. I love to learn, experiment, and create.

My digital authorship is generalled signed with  "featherless". This repo is the index of my
[featherless](https://github.com/featherless) org where I attempt to capture reflections on the
works I've taken part in.

Welcome to my digital creative history. It will always be a work in progress.

What follows is a reverse-chronological timeline. **As you scroll down you move further into my
past**. Creations are bucketed by month and I provide my annual birth date for a reference point.

### Today

Working at Google. I mentor teams interested in operating in the open. I advise on
designing shared software libraries that are used across Google's 80+ shipping iOS
applications. More and more I'm mentoring Googlers on the Swift language.

Read my personal blog at [design.featherless.software](http://design.featherless.software/).

### 2015: August

Camped with Robot Heart at Burning Man for the second time. Rigged the lights for Shady Bot, the
Heart, and helped with Brandeaux.

### 2014: November

Returned to work at Google on the [Material design team](https://design.google.com/) to complete
the work I started just before leaving in 2013.

### 2014: October

Lit Brandeaux for Robot Heart's annual halloween fundraiser.

### 2014: August

Camped with Robot Heart at Burning Man for the first time. Helped light up the Shady Bot art car.
Also left mid-way through burn week to fly directly to a friend's wedding in Toronto!

### 2013: April

I left the Google Maps iOS team after shipping v1.1 in order to travel.

I practiced my first official "step-down" process by going out of my way to hand off responsibility
to other members of the team. [mog](https://github.com/stephanemoore), for example, took ownership
of much of the day-to-day nimbus maintenance.

### 2012: December

Shipped Google Maps iOS after just six months of development.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/GoogleMaps-iOS/master/photos/google-maps-ios.jpg)

Invested significant effort in polishing the app's user experience.

I also built the foundation for what became Google's Material design iOS efforts during this time.

The app received high praise by the press:

  - Mobile App of the Year. Crunchies 2012.
  - Best User Experience. Webby Awards 2012.
  - Best Use of GPS. Webby Awards 2012.

### 2012: October

Built the "bottom drawer" gesture-driven interface as part of Google Maps iOS.

I took great care to polish the behavior of the bottom drawer. Notable behavior includes:

- the ability to dismiss the full-screen content by dragging down past the top,
- the ability to toss the drawer into a full-screen mode in a natural manner,
- support for mid-expansion and full-expansion.

One thing I would have liked to improve is for content to detach momentarily as the rubber-banding
is taking effect the content. This would provide a better hint to the: a toss to the top
user for how to dismiss the content.

I joined the Google+ team. I initially worked on the Google+ iPad app.

### 2003: February or March

Lost a significant amount of data due to a wiped hard drive.

> I've moved on, heh.

### Inspiration from late 1997: played Final Fantasy 7 for the first time

Final Fantasy 7 blew Super Mario RPG out of the water for me. I spent countless hours playing
FF7, poring over the strategy guide, even drawing the characters from the strategy guide.

### Inspiration from late 1996: played Super Mario RPG for the first time

This was the first "RPG" I ever played. The characters + story + gameplay mechanics all drove
me to play through the entire game in a way that no other game had for me to that point.

## ↑ turned 9 :: entered grade 4 ↑

I spent a good deal of my second and third grade years making "paper platformer" games.
I would take a piece of paper, fold it down the middle vertical and then make four
equally-spaced horizontal cuts. This allowed me to make a "book" with a front and back cover
and 7 internal "full-width" pages.

Each full-width page was a hand-drawn level that looked like a cut-out side view of a building.
There were monsters that you'd have to blow up with bazookas, trampolines to jump over chasms
with, and ladders to move between levels.

Thinking back on it now, I think I may have been inspired by and attempting to recreate Bugs
Bunny for the Game Boy. I wasn't allowed to bring my Game Boy to school, so I'd draw these paper
games and play them on the bus instead.

I made that room *spotless*.

- Prince of Persia
- King's Quest
