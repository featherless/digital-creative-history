  "body": "# Digital Creative History\r\n\r\nHey. The name's Jeff. I love to learn, experiment, and create.\r\n\r\nMy digital authorship is generalled signed with  \"featherless\". This repo is the index of my\r\n[featherless](https://github.com/featherless) org where I attempt to capture reflections on the\r\nworks I've taken part in.\r\n\r\nWelcome to my digital creative history. It will always be a work in progress.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a reverse-chronological timeline. **As you scroll down you move further into my\r\npast**. Creations are bucketed by month and I provide my annual birth date for a reference point.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Today\r\n\r\nWorking at Google. I mentor teams interested in operating in the open. I advise on\r\ndesigning shared software libraries that are used across Google's 80+ shipping iOS\r\napplications. More and more I'm mentoring Googlers on the Swift language.\r\n\r\nRead my personal blog at [design.featherless.software](http://design.featherless.software/).\r\n\r\n### 2016: April\r\n\r\nHad a blast making one hour of a 24 hour mix collection of music with a friend.\r\n\r\n[The Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102507563304900&set=a.10101448998781690.2346833.6912638&type=3&theater)\r\n\r\n[Check out the entire 24 hours](http://0024soundtrack2016.tumblr.com/)\r\n\r\n[Our mix, under the name m i t t e n s n m o c h i](https://soundcloud.com/mittensnmochi/2300h)\r\n\r\n![Disc](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/942229_10102507563304900_6307104778981752300_n.jpg?oh=b22f124dedab00c2c18c86e571267b2d&oe=57759488)\r\n\r\n### 2016: January\r\n\r\nI started learning how to mix electronic music using a Traktor Kontrol S2. I made a goal for myself\r\nto do two things as often as I could:\r\n\r\n- Listen to 100 new tracks from Soundcloud.\r\n- Make a mix.\r\n\r\nI listen to a lot of electronic music so I also spin a lot of different kinds of sets. I don't plan\r\nto focus on any one genre over another until I feel that my technical skills have developed. My\r\nprimary goal is to keep having fun while doing this.\r\n\r\n[Listen to all sets I've made thus far on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/featherless/sets/locally-grown-artisanal-sets).\r\n\r\n![DJ'ing](photos/dj.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 2015: August\r\n\r\nCamped with Robot Heart at Burning Man for the second time. Rigged the lights for Shady Bot, the\r\nHeart, and helped with Brandeaux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 28 :: 2015 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2014: November\r\n\r\nReturned to work at Google on the [Material design team](https://design.google.com/) to complete\r\nthe work I started just before leaving in 2013.\r\n\r\n### 2014: October\r\n\r\nLit Brandeaux for Robot Heart's annual halloween fundraiser.\r\n\r\n### 2014: August\r\n\r\nCamped with Robot Heart at Burning Man for the first time. Helped light up the Shady Bot art car.\r\nAlso left mid-way through burn week to fly directly to a friend's wedding in Toronto!\r\n\r\n[Learn more about ShadyBot](https://github.com/featherless/ShadyBot).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/featherless/ShadyBot/raw/master/photos/IMG_1721.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 27 :: Returned to Google :: 2014 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2013: August\r\n\r\nOrganized camp Pixel Heart + Buddha Lounge on the Burning Man esplanade at the 7:30 portal.\r\n\r\n[See pictures, schematics, and learn more about the Pixel Heart camp](https://github.com/featherless/PixelHeart-Esplanade)\r\n\r\n![Camp schematic](https://github.com/featherless/PixelHeart-Esplanade/raw/master/photos/schematic.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 26 :: Went backpacking :: 2013 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2013: July\r\n\r\nBrought the Pixel Heart to Lightning in a Bottle.\r\n\r\n[See pictures and learn more about our Lightning in a Bottle experience](https://github.com/featherless/PixelHeart-LightningInABottle)\r\n\r\n![Camp schematic](https://github.com/featherless/PixelHeart-LightningInABottle/raw/master/photos/heartvan.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 2013: April\r\n\r\nI left the Google Maps iOS team after shipping v1.1 in order to travel.\r\n\r\nI practiced my first official \"step-down\" process by going out of my way to hand off responsibility\r\nto other members of the team. [mog](https://github.com/stephanemoore), for example, took ownership\r\nof much of the day-to-day nimbus maintenance.\r\n\r\n### 2012: December\r\n\r\nShipped Google Maps iOS after just six months of development.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/GoogleMaps-iOS/master/photos/google-maps-ios.jpg)\r\n\r\nInvested significant effort in polishing the app's user experience.\r\n\r\nI also built the foundation for what became Google's Material design iOS efforts during this time.\r\n\r\nThe app received high praise by the press:\r\n\r\n  - Mobile App of the Year. Crunchies 2012.\r\n  - Best User Experience. Webby Awards 2012.\r\n  - Best Use of GPS. Webby Awards 2012.\r\n\r\n### 2012: October\r\n\r\nBuilt the \"bottom drawer\" gesture-driven interface as part of Google Maps iOS.\r\n\r\nI took great care to polish the behavior of the bottom drawer. Notable behavior includes:\r\n\r\n- the ability to dismiss the full-screen content by dragging down past the top,\r\n- the ability to toss the drawer into a full-screen mode in a natural manner,\r\n- support for mid-expansion and full-expansion.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would have liked to improve is for content to detach momentarily as the rubber-banding\r\nis taking effect the content. This would provide a better hint to the: a toss to the top\r\nuser for how to dismiss the content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 25 :: Launched Google Maps iOS :: 2012 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2012: February\r\n\r\nMoved to a new team at Google.\r\n\r\nI moved to the Google+ games iOS team where I built and documented\r\n[a significant amount of the API](https://developers.google.com/games/services/ios/quickstart).\r\n\r\n### 2011: September\r\n\r\nStarted my first full-time salaried job at Google.\r\n\r\nI joined the Google+ team. I initially worked on the Google+ iPad app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 24 :: joined Google full time :: 2011 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2011: June\r\n\r\nStarted working on the [Nimbus iOS libraries](http://nimbuskit.info).\r\n\r\n### 2011: June\r\n\r\nI stopped working on the Facebook iPad app.\r\n\r\n### 2010: December\r\n\r\nGraduated from university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 23 :: graduated university :: 2010 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2010: June\r\n\r\nI took on the Facebook iPad app project as the sole engineer. I worked closely with Brandon\r\nWalkin through this time.\r\n\r\n### 2010: May\r\n\r\nMy mother passed away unexpectedly. I started a habit of writing notes of appreciation to\r\npeople. Sometimes I give the note to the person. Sometimes I stick the note in a book I keep\r\nin a safe place. I also started making regular digital backups of my life including tax\r\nfilings, employment information, landlord and rental information, and passwords to various\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n### 2009: September to December\r\n\r\nSecond internship at Facebook.\r\n\r\nI worked with Owen Yamauchi and Joe Hewitt on the Facebook iOS app. I took ownership of the\r\nThree20 project after the internship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 22 :: entered fifth year of university :: 2009 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2009: January to April\r\n\r\nFirst internship at Facebook.\r\n\r\nI worked on chat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 21 :: entered fourth year of university :: 2008 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2008: May to August\r\n\r\nInternship at Google.\r\n\r\nI worked on the Google Calendar team. I made it so that event chips are the color of the calendar\r\nyou're about to create them on (they used to just always be grey).\r\n\r\n### 2007: September to December\r\n\r\nThird internship at Sony Creative Software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 20 :: entered third year of university :: 2007 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2007: January to April\r\n\r\nSecond internship at Sony Creative Software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 19 :: entered second year of university :: 2006 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2006: May to August\r\n\r\nFirst internship at Sony Creative Software.\r\n\r\n### 2006: March\r\n\r\nWon 1st place for [Hunger Strike!](https://github.com/featherless/HungerStrike) in the\r\n[72 hour game development competition](https://github.com/featherless/2003-2006-72hourgdc).\r\n\r\n[Get the source to the game and see some paper scribbles](https://github.com/featherless/HungerStrike).\r\n\r\n![Level 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/2006-HungerStrike/master/photos/level1.gif)\r\n![Level 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/2006-HungerStrike/master/photos/level2.gif)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/featherless/HungerStrike/raw/master/photos/shot1.gif)\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 18 :: entered university :: 2005 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2005: Summer\r\n\r\nRedesigned [TheJeffFiles.com](https://github.com/featherless/2004-2007-TheJeffFiles).\r\n\r\n![TheJeffFiles.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/2004-2007-TheJeffFiles/master/gfx/2005-summer.png)\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 17 :: entered grade 12 :: 2004 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2004: Summer\r\n\r\nCreated a [LWO file format renderer](https://github.com/featherless/2004-lwo-renderer).\r\n\r\n![LWO Renderer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/2004-lwo-renderer/master/lworender.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 2004: March\r\n\r\nRebuilt the [Blood Right 3D engine](https://github.com/featherless/2002-2004-Blood-Right) again, this time with support\r\nfor loading real models, moving entities, and particle systems.\r\n\r\n![3d engine v2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/2002-2003-Blood-Right/master/videos/3denginev2.gif)\r\n\r\n### 2004: January\r\n\r\nLaunched [TheJeffFiles.com](https://github.com/featherless/2004-2007-TheJeffFiles), my personal website:\r\n\r\n![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/2004-2007-TheJeffFiles/master/gfx/logo2.gif)\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 16 :: entered grade 11 :: 2003 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2003: July\r\n\r\nMade a [garage sale application](https://github.com/featherless/2003-GarageSale).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featherless/2003-GarageSale/master/gfx/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n### 2003: Summer\r\n\r\nAttended the National Youth Leadership Forum on Technology.

I would take a piece\r\nof paper, fold it down the middle vertical and then make four equally-spaced horizontal cuts.\r\nThis allowed me to make a \"book\" with a front and back cover and 7 internal \"full-width\" pages.\r\n\r\nEach full-width page was a hand-drawn level that looked like a cut-out side view of a building.\r\nThere were monsters that you'd have to blow up with bazookas, trampolines to jump over chasms\r\nwith, and ladders to move between levels.\r\n\r\nThinking back on it now, I may have been attempting to recreate Bugs Bunny for the Game Boy.\r\nI wasn't allowed to bring my Game Boy to school, so I'd draw these paper games and play them\r\non the bus instead.\r\n\r\n![Paper games](photos/papergames.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 7 :: entered grade 2 :: 1994 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 6 :: entered grade 1 :: 1993 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ turned 5 :: 1992 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">↑ Born in 1987 ↑</p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n",
